# Arduino-based Turbo Control System

This document outlines the steps and components needed to create a turbo control system for a motorcycle using Arduino. This system uses a pressure sensor to monitor turbocharger boost pressure and controls a fuel pump based on the detected pressure.

## Parts List

- **Arduino UNO R3**
- **Digital Pressure Sensor** (3.3-5V, 0-40KPa)
- **Relay Module** (compatible with Arduino, capable of handling 12V for the pump)
- **12V DC Power Source** (for the pump and Arduino board)
- **Various Cables and Connectors** (for connections)
- **Breadboard or PCB** (for organizing the setup)

## Wiring Diagram

1. Connect the GND of the Arduino to the ground of your 12V power source and to the GND of the pressure sensor.
2. Connect the 5V output from the Arduino to the VCC of the pressure sensor.
3. Connect a digital I/O pin (e.g., D2) of the Arduino to the data/output pin of the pressure sensor.
4. Connect another digital I/O pin (e.g., D9) to the signal/input pin of the relay module.
5. For the relay module, connect its GND to the Arduino's GND, and its VCC to the Arduino's 5V.
6. Wire the relay to control the power to the pump. Connect the 12V power source to the common (COM) terminal of the relay, and connect the normally open (NO) terminal to the pump's power input.

## Arduino IDE Installation and Setup

1. **Download and Install Arduino IDE**:
   - Go to the [Arduino website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) and download the latest version of the Arduino IDE for your operating system.
   - Follow the installation instructions provided on the website.

2. **Install Necessary Libraries**:
   - Depending on your pressure sensor model, you might need specific libraries. For generic digital sensors, no additional libraries are usually required.
   - To install a library, open the Arduino IDE, go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries, and search for the library you need.

## Loading Code onto Arduino

1. **Connect Your Arduino to Your Computer**:
   - Use a USB cable to connect your Arduino UNO to your computer.

2. **Open Arduino IDE**:
   - Launch the Arduino IDE on your computer.

3. **Write or Paste Your Code**:
   - You can use the basic code provided earlier in this document.

4. **Select the Correct Board and Port**:
   - Go to Tools > Board and select "Arduino UNO".
   - Go to Tools > Port and select the port that shows your Arduino (it varies depending on your computer and operating system).

5. **Upload the Code**:
   - Click the Upload button (right arrow icon) in the Arduino IDE. Your code will compile and then upload to the Arduino. 
   - Once the upload is complete, the IDE will display a message indicating successful upload.

6. **Test Your Setup**:
   - With everything connected, apply pressure to the sensor and observe if the relay activates the pump as expected.

Please ensure all connections are secure and correct before powering up the system. It is advisable to test the system in a controlled environment to ensure its functionality and safety.
